# Export / Import Utilities

- `export.ts` (TBD): Streams transactions, budgets, and reports to CSV/PDF/JSON per Section 10 of `docs/architecture.md`.
- `import.ts` (TBD): Validates encrypted bundles, runs dry-run checks, and merges records idempotently.

Add scripts in this directory and document invocation examples in `README.md`.
